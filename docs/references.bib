Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present {DESeq}2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The {DESeq}2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/{DESeq}2.html webcite.},

            Natural killer ({NK}) cells are in development for allogeneic immunotherapy; however, for such use as off‐the‐shelf medicines, {NK} cells need to undergo ex vivo expansion, typically through activation with feeder cells and cytokines, to generate sufficient cells for clinical applications. Upon stimulation with feeder cells in the presence of cytokines, {NK} cells undergo profound changes in gene expression, altering their metabolic activity, cell cycle progression, and growth behavior, but the precise changes that drive this transformation remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified significant differences in the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility of {NK} cells 7 days after feeder cell and cytokine activation, with the changes even more pronounced in genome regions closer to enhancers. Several transcription factors, including {AP}‐1, {IRF}4, {STATs}, T‐bet, Eomes, and {bHLHE}40, which play key roles in {NK} cell development and immune response, exhibited differential binding activity between unstimulated and day 7 {NK} cells. Gene sets composed of target genes downstream of these transcription factors were also enriched at day 7, implying their involvement in {NK} cell activation. Moreover, we compared potential super‐enhancer regions in {NK} cells before and after activation, combined with the transcriptional activity of nearby genes. We identified stable and transcriptionally active super‐enhancers in unstimulated and day 7 {NK} cells, as well as those that form or disappear after co‐culture initiation. The transcriptomic and epigenetic characterization of {NK} cells presented in this study could facilitate the ex vivo expansion and engineering of functionally superior {NK} cells.},

              The aryl hydrocarbon receptor ({AHR}) is an environmental sensor that integrates microbial and dietary cues to influence physiological processes within the intestinal microenvironment, protecting against colitis and colitis-associated colorectal cancer development. Rapid tissue regeneration upon injury is important for the reinstatement of barrier integrity and its dysregulation promotes malignant transformation. Here we show that {AHR} is important for the termination of the regenerative response and the reacquisition of mature epithelial cell identity post injury in vivo and in organoid cultures in vitro. Using an integrative multi-omics approach in colon organoids, we show that {AHR} is required for timely termination of the regenerative response through direct regulation of transcription factors involved in epithelial cell differentiation as well as restriction of chromatin accessibility to regeneration-associated
